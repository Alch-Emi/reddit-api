# Contributing to rawr
All contributions are appreciated, however small. To ensure things go smoothly, here's a quick guide about how you should
contribute effectively.

## Identifying the Issue
Before starting work on a fix, make sure you've logged the bug on the issue tracker (if you've found an issue yourself) or sent a message
saying that you're planning on working on an issue. This will ensure that other contributors don't work on the same thing as you and
cause merge issues or waste time duplicating code.

## Before Committing
Please make sure that:

- The build passes with *no warnings*.
- Documentation tests are added where appropriate.
- The tests pass with *no warnings*.

## Committing and Sending a PR
Try to write descriptive commit messages, and squash related commits so the Git history is nice and clear. In the pull request,
summarise your changes and link any issues that you would close with this PR.
